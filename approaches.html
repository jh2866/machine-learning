					<h4>Sparse dictionary learning</h4>
					<p>
						In this method, a datum is represented as a linear combination of
						basis functions, and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse. Let
						x be a d-dimensional datum, D be a d by n matrix, where each column
						of D represents a basis function. r is the coefficient to represent
						x using D. Generally speaking, n is assumed to be larger than d to
						allow the freedom for a sparse representation. <br /><br />Learning
						a dictionary along with sparse representations is strongly NP-hard
						and also difficult to solve approximately. <br /><br />
						A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is K-SVD.
						Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In
						classification, the problem is to determine which classes a
						previously unseen datum belongs to. Suppose a dictionary for each
						class has already been built. Then a new datum is associated with
						the class such that it's best sparsely represented by the
						corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been
						applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image
						patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the
						noise cannot.

					<h4>Rule-based machine learning</h4>
					<p>
						Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine
						learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to
						store, manipulate or apply, knowledge. The defining characteristic
						of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and
						utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent
						the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other
						machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be
						universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.
						Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier
						systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.

					<h4>Representation learning</h4>
					<p>
						Several learning algorithms, mostly unsupervised learning
						algorithms, aim at discovering better representations of the inputs
						provided during training. Classical examples include principal
						components analysis and cluster analysis. Representation learning
						algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input
						but transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a
						pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions,
						allowing reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data
						generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful for
						configurations that are implausible under that distribution. <br />
						<br />

						Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint
						that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding
						algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned
						representation is sparse (has many zeros). Multilinear subspace
						learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations
						directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data,
						without reshaping them into (high-dimensional) vectors. Deep
						learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a
						hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features
						defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has
						been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a
						representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation
						that explain the observed data.

                    <h4>Inductive logic programming</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation
                        for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set
                        of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that
                        entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of
                        programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.

                    <h4>Artificial neural networks</h4>
                    <p>
                        An artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithm, usually called "neural network" (NN), is a learning algorithm
                        that is vaguely inspired by biological neural networks. Computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group
                        of artificial neurons, processing information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are
                        non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and
                        outputs, to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution
                        between observed variables.

                    <h4>Clustering</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within
                        the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, while observations drawn from
                        different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the
                        data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness (similarity between
                        members of the same cluster) and separation between different clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density
                        and graph connectivity. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data
                        analysis.
